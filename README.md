            Email Verification Link 
            Signup with email, pass 
            Login with emal, pass
            Sign in with google
            Animated Screens
            Forgot/Reset Password
            Delete Account 

Yet to do:


            Google map already knew previous location (stored locally)
            realtime error display (debug console ones)
